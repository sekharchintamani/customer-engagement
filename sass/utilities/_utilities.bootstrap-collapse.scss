   # BOOTSTRAP COLLAPSE

/**
  * These selectors are used by hte Bootstrap javascript we're including to collapse
  * the main navigation on mobile screens.
  *
  * As authored below, this will only collapse elements up to the "mediumlarge"
  * breakpoint. This is a hack; The bootstrap collapse script is intended to
  * work at any window size. We're doing this since we've only included
  * the collapse script to mirror the beavior of the main WP site's mobile nav.
  *
  * Since the mobilenav DOM is the same as for desktop, we don't want the menu
  * to be hidden at desktop-sizes.
  *
  * TODO: Ideally, we should replace the bootstrap script with something functionally
  * equivalent that applies configurable BEM classes, moving these
  * properties to a mixin and adding to its module.
